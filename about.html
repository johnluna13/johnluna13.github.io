<h1>About Me</h1>
I am a Colombian born visual artist, who migrated to the US at the age of 8 and has resided in Miami for 13 years. 
Currently enrolled in the Miami International University of Art and Design. My main focus as an artist is to create portraits that allow
<br>
you (the viewer) to share something personal with the subject of the portrait. This feeling is acheived by creating a double exposure effect
within the portrait.
<p>
As a visual artist I do a lot of mixed media, even though my main work is done with charcoal. My portraits have been created with media such as 
water colour and digitally illustrated
