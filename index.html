  <h2>Artist bio/Statement</h2>
<img alt="Portrait of John Luna" width="300" src="http://i.imgur.com/RZv7S83.jpg">
<h4>Portrait of John Luna by Emilia Rinaldini</h4>

<br>
 Colombian born visual artist, who migrated to the United States at the age of eight and has resided in Miami for 
fourteen years. Currently enrolled in the visual arts program at the Miami International University of Art and Design.
 <p> Luna has created two main bodies of work. The first one 
consisted of a body of large scale charcoal portraits, which 
utilized double exposure to add a second image of the subjects 
personal life. By doing so, Luna wanted to achieve a personal connection and a visual conversation between the viewer and the portrait. Even thought his “Getting to Know You” series is mainly presented through large scale charcoal portraits, Luna plans to utilize other media such as watercolor, pastels, and illustration as future entrees to his ongoing series.
<p>The second body of work from Luna is titled “Art of the 
Hungry”. The series comes from a moment in Luna’s life where he found himself struggling and decided to make art more 
accessible to the public in order to generate a form of 
revenue. The series is composed of digtal illustrations which Luna consiously created with no definitive tone, as he wished to create simple art that everyone could relate to. The main idea is to generate an image that will be simple enough for 
anyone to appreciate, while keeping the design interesting and complex. The illustrations in this series depict things like 
magestic animal-like creatures that work to represent the 
zodiac signs, designs relating to cult classic movies, ancient art and artifacts illustrated in the style of luna, as well as 
political and social satire. Ultimately Luna’s vision for the 
series going forward would be producing a limited series of products with his designs on them.
